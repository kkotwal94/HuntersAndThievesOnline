# Hunters and Thieves
How to play:
 
    Once two players have chosen a nickname, joined a lobby, readied up, then hit the start button
    the initial phase begins where each player may maneuver their units around the board to the 
    starting positions of their choosing. Each player must also hide their gold somewhere on their
    side of the board. When both players are done setting their pieces the game begins. The game is
    turn based and turns are spent either moving a piece, placing a mine, or killing an enemy. One 
    action per turn until one person reaches a win condition listed below.

Win the game in one of two ways:

    1. Being the first team to use their units (minus decoy units described below) to locate and 
       capture the enemy gold 
    2. Being the first team to eliminating the opposing team.

Characters and Movement:
 
    All: Take downs work like chess, moving a unit over an opposing unit and they are defeated. 
    If any unit lands on an enemy mine they die. If any unit beside decoys lands on gold it is captured.
 
    Thief: Moves like a knight from chess but with as long an "L" as you want so to speak.
 
    Hunter: Moves like a king but an extra space of movement up, down, left, and right. 
 
    Underling: Moves one space up, down, left, or right.

    Decoy X: Decoy units move just like the normal unit but cannot kill enemy units, just used for
    intimidation and scouting. If a decoy lands on gold (???????)

Spectating:

    If you join and a lobby is full you can still choose a nickname, watch the game unfold play by play,
    chat with the players / others spectating, and you can even feel free to move around the pieces 
    yourself, nothing will be disrupted.
